		<p>Many people believe that Leonardo Di Caprio deserved the Oscar
more for Shutter Island and The Wolf of Wall Street instead of his win
for the Revenant. Irrespective of this sentiment, he is indeed one of
the best actors of this generation. His movies with Martin Scorsese
are a treat to watch.</p>
